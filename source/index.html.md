<h2>Enable Data Transfer between Multiple Services</h2>
<p>Syndesis utilizes a browser-based interface that allows users to easily create and manage data integrations using pre-defined connections.</p>
<p>Thanks to the power of <a href="http://camel.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Camel">Apache Camel</a>, Syndesis allows users to integrate all widely used services and software from the UI, transforming data on demand.</p>
<p>Switch between the designer in your browser and code in your IDE for full control and flexibility.</p>
